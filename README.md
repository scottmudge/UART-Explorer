# UART Explorer

##
File browser and transfer application using UART interface.

Have you ever wanted to browse a device like a normal file-system when connected via a terminal session over UART? Are you tired of manually copying hex dumps from logs to transfer binary files over a debug interface?

Well now you don't have to!
